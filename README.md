# opengl

I came accross an amazing tutorial about opengl for Ubuntu Linux. It took some time to get it up and running on my Distros. I decided to create a script to help others to get started with this tutorial.

Youtube channel: OGLDEV

As always, read the code of the script before execution. And I am not responsable for the contents of the tutorial itself and for misfunction of this script. Otherwise improve the script and redistribute it.
